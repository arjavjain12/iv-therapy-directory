# Getting Started with the Yelp Places API

The Yelp Places API allows you to get the best local content and user reviews from millions of businesses around the world. This tutorial provides an overview of the capabilities our suite of APIs offer, provides instructions for how to authenticate API calls, and walks through a simple scenario using the API.

Learn more about the full suite of Data Licensing products, features and use-cases [here](https://business.yelp.com/data)

### Plan and Pricing   [Skip link to Plan and Pricing](https://docs.developer.yelp.com/docs/places-intro\#plan-and-pricing)

Choose a plan that fits your development needs and start your free trial [here](https://business.yelp.com/data/products/fusion/)

### Authentication   [Skip link to Authentication](https://docs.developer.yelp.com/docs/places-intro\#authentication)

The Yelp Places API uses private key authentication to authenticate all endpoints. Your private API Key will be automatically generated after you create your app. For detailed instructions, refer to our [authentication guide](https://docs.developer.yelp.com/docs/fusion-authentication).

### Endpoints   [Skip link to Endpoints](https://docs.developer.yelp.com/docs/places-intro\#endpoints)

### Using the API   [Skip link to Using the API](https://docs.developer.yelp.com/docs/places-intro\#using-the-api)

Let's use a simple scenario to demonstrate how to use the Yelp Places API. Imagine you are building an app to help people find great food nearby and you want to provide a search experience.

1. A user enters "del" in the search box.
2. They are provided a few autocomplete suggestions, like "delivery" and "delis".
3. They choose "delis" to see what options they have nearby.
4. They choose "delivery" since they do not want to go out to get the food.
5. They are offered a list of all the restaurants which deliver to their location.
6. They choose one, view the restaurant details and reviews, then make the decision to order delivery.

The following is how you can use the Yelp Places API to implement this experience.

#### Get autocomplete suggestions based on user's input   [Skip link to Get autocomplete suggestions based on user's input](https://docs.developer.yelp.com/docs/places-intro\#get-autocomplete-suggestions-based-on-users-input)

As the user is typing, you can monitor the user's input and call our autocomplete endpoint in real time. It's always good to also provide the latitude and longitude parameters so that you receive suggestions on businesses based on location.

Shell

```shell
GET https://api.yelp.com/v3/autocomplete?text=del&latitude=37.786882&longitude=-122.399972
```

In the response body below, you can see that it's returning suggestions for terms, businesses and categories.

JSON

```json
{
  "terms": [\
    {\
      "text": "Delivery"\
    }\
  ],
  "businesses": [\
    {\
      "id": "YqvoyaNvtoC8N5dA8pD2JA",\
      "name": "Delfina"\
    },\
    {\
      "id": "vu6PlPyKptsT6oEq50qOzA",\
      "name": "Delarosa"\
    },\
    {\
      "id": "bai6umLcCNy9cXql0Js2RQ",\
      "name": "Pizzeria Delfina"\
    }\
  ],
  "categories": [\
    {\
      "alias": "delis",\
      "title": "Delis"\
    },\
    {\
      "alias": "fooddeliveryservices",\
      "title": "Food Delivery Services"\
    },\
    {\
      "alias": "couriers",\
      "title": "Couriers & Delivery Services"\
    }\
  ]
}
```

#### Search for businesses with a keyword   [Skip link to Search for businesses with a keyword](https://docs.developer.yelp.com/docs/places-intro\#search-for-businesses-with-a-keyword)

Once the user selects "delis" from the autocomplete suggestions as the search keyword, you can call the Search endpoint to find restaurants matching the keyword. Again, by providing the latitude and longitude parameters, you'll get the best results which take location into consideration.

Shell

```shell
GET https://api.yelp.com/v3/businesses/search?term=delis&latitude=37.786882&longitude=-122.399972
```

In the response body below, you'll get a list of businesses with valuable information such as name, address, phone number, Yelp rating, price levels, and review counts. The URL of the restaurant points the corresponding Yelp business page. Deeplinks ensure that the Yelp mobile app opens to the desired page, if installed. If not installed, users are taken to Yelp's mobile website.

JSON

```json
{
  "total": 1316,
  "businesses": [\
    {\
      "rating": 4.5,\
      "price": "$$",\
      "phone": "+14154212337",\
      "id": "molinari-delicatessen-san-francisco",\
      "categories": [\
        {\
          "alias": "delis",\
          "title": "Delis"\
        }\
      ],\
      "review_count": 910,\
      "name": "Molinari Delicatessen",\
      "url": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/molinari-delicatessen-san-francisco",\
      "coordinates": {\
        "latitude": 37.7983818054199,\
        "longitude": -122.407821655273\
      },\
      "image_url": "http://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6He-NlZrAv2mDV-yg6jW3g/o.jpg",\
      "location": {\
        "city": "San Francisco",\
        "country": "US",\
        "address2": "",\
        "address3": "",\
        "state": "CA",\
        "address1": "373 Columbus Ave",\
        "zip_code": "94133"\
      }\
    },\
    // ...\
  ]
}
```

#### Search for businesses supporting delivery   [Skip link to Search for businesses supporting delivery](https://docs.developer.yelp.com/docs/places-intro\#search-for-businesses-supporting-delivery)

Once the user selects "Delivery" from the autocomplete suggestions as the search keyword, you can call the Transaction Search endpoint to find businesses which deliver to the user's location. Here the latitude and longitude parameters are required since delivery availability depends on the location of the delivery. You can also pass in a different location to implement the case where the user will request delivery from a different location.

Shell

```shell
GET https://api.yelp.com/v3/transactions/delivery/search?latitude=37.786882&longitude=-122.399972
```

The response body right now is pretty much the same as search endpoint response body.

JSON

```json
{
  "total": 25,
  "businesses": [\
    {\
      "rating": 4,\
      "image_url": "",\
      "name": "North India Restaurant",\
      "url": "https://www.yelp.com/biz/north-india-restaurant-san-francisco",\
      "review_count": 551,\
      "coordinates": {\
        "latitude": null,\
        "longitude": null\
      },\
      "id": "north-india-restaurant-san-francisco",\
      "categories": [\
        {\
          "alias": "indpak",\
          "title": "Indian"\
        }\
      ]\
    },\
    // ...\
  ]
}
```

#### Get business details and reviews   [Skip link to Get business details and reviews](https://docs.developer.yelp.com/docs/places-intro\#get-business-details-and-reviews)

Finally, you can call the Business Details endpoint and Reviews endpoint to retrieve business details and up to 3 review excerpts.

To get business detail information, you can make the following call.

Shell

```shell
GET https://api.yelp.com/v3/businesses/north-india-restaurant-san-francisco
```

In the response body right now, you'll get up to 3 additional photos and hours of the business.

JSON

```json
{
  "rating": 4,
  "price": "$$",
  "hours": [\
    {\
      "hours_type": "REGULAR",\
      "open": [\
        {\
          "is_overnight": false,\
