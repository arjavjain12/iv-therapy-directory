## Frequently Asked Questions

What is the Yelp Places API?

The Yelp Places API provides developers access to Yelp’s extensive local content and search capabilities for millions of businesses and allows public display of Yelp data within third-party apps, platforms and websites.

How can I get started using the Yelp Places API?

Sign up for a 30-day free trial plan and start using the Yelp Places API. A Yelp user account is required to generate API credentials. Alternatively, you can speak to our team to get started if you have specific needs or questions about adding the Yelp Places API to your product.

Do you offer a trial of Yelp Places API?

Yes, we offer a free 30-day Yelp Places API trial. [Click here](https://business.yelp.com/data/products/places-api/#pricing) to get started.

What is the difference between Yelp Places API and Yelp Insights API?

Both products provide API Access to Yelp’s core dataset.

Yelp Places API is designed for consumer-facing products, displaying Yelp search and business data on third-party apps, platforms and websites.

Yelp Insights API serves business-to-business (B2B) use cases, providing location data and web traffic analytics for internal, non-public/back-end purposes such as internal analysis. There are no display rights associated with a Yelp Insights API license.

How do I transition from a Yelp Places API trial license to a commercial license?

At the end of your 30-day free trial, you can subscribe to a commercial license plan from your developer account. If you require more than 5,000 daily API calls, please [contact us](https://business.yelp.com/data/products/places-api/#form).

How many reviews can I access per business?

The Plus plan offers up to 3 reviews per business, while the Enterprise plan allows up to 7 reviews. Both plans provide the first 160 characters of a review.

What happens if I exceed my daily API request limit?

Exceeding the limit results in a 429 status code (Too Many Requests). Limits reset at midnight UTC. Continued attempts to exceed the daily API limit may result in suspension or termination of API access without a commercial license.

How much does it cost to use the Yelp Places API?

Pricing varies by plan and the number of daily API calls you make. See our [pricing page](https://business.yelp.com/data/resources/pricing/) for more details.
