## FAQ

Most frequent questions and answers

How Pay as You Go Works?

Pay as You Go allows you to pay only for the services you consume, without monthly subscription fees. It is the same as paying for utilities like water and electricity.

How Payment Works?

A new billing period will be created when you start a task without an active billing period. Once you have the amount due, _you can stop it manually by clicking “Generate Invoice”, or it will be finished automatically in one month_. Once it’s finished, you will receive an invoice for the usage of the services.

## Free Tier

Free Tier is the amount of usage you can use for free each month. For example, some product X has a Free Tier with 500 requests per month. This means any usage of the product below 500 requests during a month will be for free.

## Referral Program

## What Clients Say?

[![Dion Kenney](https://outscraper.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/client_8.webp)\\
Dion KenneyCOO of Mondofora](https://twitter.com/mondofora)

I wish I had found it sooner. I've been manually collecting data from Google Maps for the past 15 months!
The first search produced more usable data in 20 minutes than my 15 months did altogether.

Ian MasonCTO](https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/64d24d6f30844116cc798b25)

Outscraper is the best scraper I've found. I cannot believe how well it works, how much data I get back, with no errors or headaches. I can make any directory site I want now

[![Mihai Vinatoru](https://outscraper.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/customer1.webp)\\

Outscraper is providing fast and reliable data on Google Maps locations, in a simple and intuitive interface. The platform has advanced features, yet is user friendly enough. In the last 12 months, we used Outscraper to extract relevant public data regarding 120,000+ locations.

Outscraper is the best API service I’ve ever had to discover by pure luck (in an article from Medium.com) - was seeking something like this since 2019 and this platform is the only one actually working and doing the job.

I've been testing and using Outscraper for a few weeks now. I'm incredibly happy with their current offerings and I'm looking forward to them adding more public sources. Its stupid easy to use and so affordable. Thanks guys!

What an awesome tool for getting marketing lead prospects. It's much faster than the estimates they give when doing a scrape. (It's always good to under-promise & over-deliver to your customers)...

This service has been extremely helpful for me. Apart from their super fast API for various services, their amazing support is something that would make you go back to them. Dana from Outscraper team had helped me tirelessly for 3 days when I got into an issue and the dev team even made a spot update in their SDK package to suit my requirements. Highly recommended!

I wish I had found it sooner. I've been manually collecting data from Google Maps for the past 15 months!
The first search produced more usable data in 20 minutes than my 15 months did altogether.

Outscraper is the best scraper I've found. I cannot believe how well it works, how much data I get back, with no errors or headaches. I can make any directory site I want now

Outscraper is providing fast and reliable data on Google Maps locations, in a simple and intuitive interface. The platform has advanced features, yet is user friendly enough. In the last 12 months, we used Outscraper to extract relevant public data regarding 120,000+ locations.
